    "In this notebook, you built a complete robo-advisor simulation from scratch and learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Robo-Advisor Mechanics**\n",
    "   - Automated investment platforms using algorithms\n",
    "   - Low-cost alternative to traditional advisors\n",
    "   - Core features: risk profiling, portfolio optimization, rebalancing, tax harvesting\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Risk Profiling**\n",
    "   - Questionnaire-based assessment\n",
    "   - Maps investor characteristics to risk tolerance scores\n",
    "   - Drives portfolio allocation decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mean-Variance Optimization (Markowitz)**\n",
    "   - Portfolio return: weighted sum of asset returns\n",
    "   - Portfolio risk: depends on covariance between assets\n",
    "   - Efficient frontier: best risk-return tradeoffs\n",
    "   - Sharpe ratio: risk-adjusted return measure\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Automated Rebalancing**\n",
    "   - Calendar-based: rebalance on fixed schedule\n",
    "   - Threshold-based: rebalance when drift exceeds limit\n",
    "   - Tradeoff between staying on target and transaction costs\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Tax-Loss Harvesting**\n",
    "   - Sell losing positions to capture tax deductions\n",
    "   - Replace with similar assets to maintain exposure\n",
    "   - Wash sale rule: 30-day waiting period\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Robo vs Traditional Advisors**\n",
    "   - Robo: low fees, accessible, automated, limited services\n",
    "   - Traditional: comprehensive planning, personal relationship, higher fees\n",
    "   - Fee impact compounds significantly over time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Implementation Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Production robo-advisors add:\n",
    "- Real market data integration (APIs)\n",
    "- Regulatory compliance (SEC, FINRA)\n",
    "- More sophisticated optimization (Black-Litterman, risk parity)\n",
    "- Factor-based investing\n",
    "- ESG/sustainable investing options\n",
    "- Goal-based planning (retirement, house, education)\n",
