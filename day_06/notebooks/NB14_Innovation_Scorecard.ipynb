    "| Day | Concept | Application |\n",
    "|-----|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| 1 | Trust Architecture | Evaluate centralization vs. decentralization trade-offs |\n",
    "| 2 | Platform Dynamics | Assess network effects and competitive moats |\n",
    "| 3 | Technical Soundness | Analyze security, scalability, and reliability |\n",
    "| 4 | Programmability | Evaluate smart contracts and composability |\n",
    "| 5 | Risk Profile | Assess vulnerabilities and governance |\n",
    "| 6 | Future Potential | Evaluate innovation trajectory and adaptability |\n",

    "### Built an Evaluation Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "- 6 dimensions, 5 criteria each = 30 total evaluation points\n",
    "- 5-point scoring scale with weighted aggregation\n",
    "- Radar chart visualization for comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analyzed Real Innovations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stripe**: FinTech leader - strong platform, limited programmability\n",
    "- **Uniswap**: DeFi pioneer - maximum programmability, regulatory uncertainty\n",
    "- **Digital Euro**: CBDC proposal - sovereign backing, limited innovation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No perfect solution**: Every innovation makes trade-offs\n",
    "2. **Context matters**: Different use cases favor different models\n",
    "3. **Convergence is coming**: The future likely combines elements of all approaches\n",
    "4. **Framework thinking**: Systematic evaluation beats intuition\n",
    "5. **Continuous evolution**: Today's scores will change as innovations mature\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Apply the scorecard to innovations in your area of interest\n",
    "2. Customize weights based on your investment/career criteria\n",
    "3. Track how scores change over time\n",
    "4. Share and discuss evaluations with peers\n",
