\begin{frame}{The Hidden Journey of a Payment (cont.)}
\begin{block}{The Insight}
Each layer in the payment stack captures a portion of every transaction. Understanding the stack reveals who profits from your purchase --- and where disruption is possible.

\begin{frame}{The Four-Party Model}
\begin{alertblock}{The Problem}
When you swipe your card, who is involved and what happens?
\end{alertblock}

\vspace{2mm}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=2.5cm, auto]
% Nodes
\node (cardholder) [blockchain] {Cardholder};
\node (merchant) [blockchain, right of=cardholder, xshift=4cm] {Merchant};
\node (issuer) [blockchain, below of=cardholder] {Issuing Bank};
\node (acquirer) [blockchain, below of=merchant] {Acquiring Bank};
\node (network) [blockchain, below of=cardholder, xshift=3.5cm, fill=dfteal!20] {Card Network};

% Arrows - NO dollar amounts
\draw[arrow] (cardholder) -- node[above] {1. Presents card} (merchant);
\draw[arrow] (merchant) -- node[right] {2. Auth request} (acquirer);
\draw[arrow] (acquirer) -- node[below] {3. Route} (network);
\draw[arrow] (network) -- node[below] {4. Verify funds} (issuer);
\draw[arrow] (issuer) -- node[left] {5. Approve/Decline} (cardholder);
\draw[arrow, dashed, color=dfgreen] (issuer) |- ++(0,-1.5) -| node[below, pos=0.25] {6. Settlement (days later)} (acquirer);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Four-Party Model (cont.)}
\begin{block}{The Insight}
Authorization happens in seconds; settlement takes days. The merchant sees ``approved'' almost instantly, but the actual money moves much later in batch processing.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Who Pays Whom?}
\begin{alertblock}{The Problem}
Who actually pays for the ``free'' card in your wallet?
\end{alertblock}

\vspace{3mm}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{p{2.8cm}p{4.5cm}p{4cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Party} & \textbf{Role} & \textbf{How They Earn} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Cardholder} & Initiates payment & (Consumer --- pays indirectly through prices) \\
\textbf{Merchant} & Accepts payment & Sells goods/services \\
\textbf{Issuing Bank} & Issues card, bears risk & Receives the largest share of fees \\
\textbf{Acquiring Bank} & Processes for merchant & Keeps a small portion of fees \\
\textbf{Card Network} & Routes transactions & Charges assessment fees \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace{3mm}
\textbf{The Fee Flow:}
Merchant pays $\rightarrow$ Acquirer passes on $\rightarrow$ Network routes $\rightarrow$ Issuer receives most

\vspace{2mm}
\begin{block}{The Insight}
The \textbf{issuing bank} receives the largest share because it bears the credit and fraud risk. The merchant passes these costs into prices --- so consumers ultimately pay, even if their card is ``free.''
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Payment Methods: A Spectrum of Trade-Offs}
\begin{alertblock}{The Problem}
With so many ways to pay, how do you choose the right one?
\end{alertblock}

\vspace{2mm}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{p{3cm}ccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Speed} & \textbf{Cost} & \textbf{Consumer Protection} \\
\midrule
Wire Transfer & Slow to moderate & High (flat fee) & Very limited \\
Bank Transfer & Slow & Low & Limited \\
Card Payment & Fast auth, slow settle & Moderate (percentage) & Strong (chargebacks) \\
Digital Wallet & Fast & Moderate to high & Varies \\
Real-Time Rails & Instant & Very low & Final (no reversal) \\
Cryptocurrency & Variable & Variable & Final (no reversal) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace{3mm}
\begin{columns}[T]
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\textbf{The Fundamental Tradeoff:}\\
Fast + Cheap $\leftrightarrow$ Less consumer protection\\
Slow + Expensive $\leftrightarrow$ More certainty and recourse
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{block}{The Insight}
Every payment method is a tradeoff --- there is no single ``best'' option. The right choice depends on the specific context: speed, cost, and how much protection you need.
\end{block}
\end{column}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Real-Time Payment Systems}
\begin{alertblock}{The Problem}
What if payments could be instant \textit{and} nearly free?
\end{alertblock}

\vspace{2mm}
\begin{columns}[T]
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\textbf{The Concept:}
\begin{itemize}\compactlist
\item Governments around the world are building \textbf{real-time payment infrastructure}
\item These are public systems --- instant, low-cost, available to all banks
\item Examples exist across many countries: Brazil, India, the UK, the EU, and the US have all launched or are rolling out such systems
\item They settle in seconds, not days
\end{itemize}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\textbf{How They Differ from Cards:}
\begin{itemize}\compactlist
\item Government-operated (public good)
\item Near-zero transaction cost
\item Bank-to-bank (no intermediary network)
\item Irrevocable (no chargebacks)
\end{itemize}
\end{column}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Real-Time Payment Systems (cont.)}
\begin{block}{Impact on the Payment Landscape}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Commoditizes payment rails}: Basic money movement becomes free
\item \textbf{Threatens card networks}: Why pay a percentage fee when instant transfer is free?
\item \textbf{Enables new business models}: Micropayments, real-time payroll, instant refunds
\item \textbf{Shifts competition}: Value moves from moving money to services built on top
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\vspace{2mm}
\begin{block}{The Insight}
When the government builds free instant payment infrastructure, it changes the entire competitive landscape for private payment companies. The value shifts from \textit{moving} money to \textit{services around} money.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Cross-Border Payments: The Broken System}
\begin{alertblock}{The Problem}
Why is sending money abroad still slow and expensive?
\end{alertblock}

\node[below of=corr1, xshift=1.5cm, yshift=-0.3cm, font=\small] {\textbf{Each hop adds time and cost}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\vspace{2mm}
\textbf{Why It Is Broken:}
\begin{itemize}\compactlist
\item Money must ``hop'' through several \textbf{correspondent banks}\footnotemark --- each one charges a fee and adds delay
\item Currency conversion happens at each hop, often at unfavorable rates
\item Compliance checks (anti-money laundering) at every intermediary slow the process further
\item The sender often does not know the total cost until the money arrives
\end{itemize}
\footnotetext{Correspondent banking --- a system where banks maintain accounts at other banks in foreign countries to facilitate international transfers.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Cross-Border Payments: The Broken System (cont.)}
\begin{block}{The Insight}
Cross-border payments are the most expensive, slowest part of the payment system --- making them a prime target for FinTech disruption.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL)}
\begin{alertblock}{The Problem}
Why would a merchant pay \textit{higher} fees for installment payments?
\end{alertblock}

\vspace{2mm}
\begin{columns}[T]
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\textbf{How BNPL Works:}
\begin{enumerate}\compactlist
\item Consumer selects BNPL at checkout
\item BNPL provider pays the merchant (minus a fee)
\item Consumer repays in several installments
\item Typically no interest if payments are on time
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{2mm}
\textbf{Why Merchants Accept Higher Fees:}
\begin{itemize}\compactlist
\item Increases average order value
\item Attracts customers who might not buy otherwise
\item Converts browsers into buyers
\item Shifts credit risk to the BNPL provider
\end{itemize}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{block}{BNPL Revenue Sources}
\begin{itemize}\compactlist
\item \textbf{Merchant fees}: Higher than standard card fees --- the provider's main revenue
\item \textbf{Late payment fees}: Charged when consumers miss installments
\item \textbf{Interest}: On longer-term loan products
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{column}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) (cont.)}
\begin{alertblock}{Business Model Tensions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Credit losses without traditional underwriting\footnotemark
\item Growing regulatory scrutiny globally
\item Consumer debt accumulation concerns
\item Sustainability questions when growth slows
\end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}
\footnotetext{Underwriting --- the process of assessing whether a borrower is likely to repay.}

\vspace{2mm}
\begin{block}{The Insight}
BNPL shifts credit risk from consumers to providers, creating new business model tensions between growth and sustainability.

\begin{frame}{Hands-On: NB02 Payment Transaction Analysis}
\begin{alertblock}{The Problem}
How do we analyze payment data to make better business decisions?
\end{alertblock}

\vspace{2mm}
\begin{block}{Notebook Overview}
Analyze simulated payment transaction data to understand:
\begin{itemize}\compactlist
\item How different payment methods compare in practice
\item How fee structures affect merchant profitability
\item How settlement times vary and why it matters for cash flow
\item How network analysis can reveal transaction patterns
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\vspace{2mm}
\begin{columns}[T]
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\textbf{What You Will Do:}
\begin{itemize}\compactlist
\item Work with a realistic simulated payment dataset
\item Compare multiple payment methods across key dimensions
\item Visualize cost and settlement trade-offs
\item Build and analyze a payment network graph
\end{itemize}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{exampleblock}{No Programming Prerequisites}
The notebook is self-guided with code provided. Your job is to \textbf{interpret the results} and draw business conclusions --- not to write code from scratch.
\end{exampleblock}
\end{column}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Hands-On: NB02 Payment Transaction Analysis (cont.)}
\begin{block}{The Insight}
Data analysis reveals patterns invisible in individual transactions --- what seems random at the single-payment level becomes predictable at scale.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Section 2.1 Key Takeaways}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Payments are multi-layered}: Consumer interfaces $\rightarrow$ processors $\rightarrow$ networks $\rightarrow$ settlement systems. Each layer extracts value from every transaction.

\item \textbf{Speed vs.\ protection is the fundamental tradeoff}: Faster, cheaper payments are typically less reversible. Every payment method trades off these dimensions differently.

\item \textbf{Interchange funds the card ecosystem}: The issuing bank receives the largest share of fees because it bears credit and fraud risk. Merchants pass these costs to consumers through prices.

\item \textbf{Real-time government rails are reshaping competition}: When instant payments become free public infrastructure, the value shifts from moving money to the services built on top.

\item \textbf{Most FinTechs are layers, not replacements}: The majority of payment innovators build on top of existing rails rather than replacing them --- true disruption of the underlying infrastructure is rare.
\end{enumerate}

%                    SECTION 2.2: API ECONOMY & BaaS
% ============================================================================
\section{The API Economy and Banking-as-a-Service}

\begin{frame}{What is an API?}
\begin{alertblock}{The Problem}
How do different software systems talk to each other without knowing each other's internal workings?
\end{alertblock}

\vspace{3mm}
\begin{columns}[T]
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\textbf{Non-Technical Definition:}
\begin{itemize}
\item An API is a \textbf{contract} between software systems
\item It defines what you can \textbf{request} and what you will \textbf{receive}
\item Think of it like a restaurant menu: a fixed set of options, in a standardized format
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3mm}
\footnotesize{\textcolor{dfteal}{\textbf{Jargon explained:}} \textit{API} stands for Application Programming Interface. \textit{Endpoint} = a specific address where you send requests (like a phone number). \textit{Request} = asking for data. \textit{Response} = the data you get back.}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{block}{Why APIs Matter for Finance}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Unbundling}: Break a monolithic bank into separate, accessible components
\item \textbf{Speed}: Integrate with banking infrastructure quickly instead of building from scratch
\item \textbf{Innovation}: Any authorized developer can access banking capabilities
\item \textbf{Competition}: A more level playing field between incumbents and startups
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{column}
\end{columns}

\vspace{2mm}
\begin{block}{The Insight}
APIs let any developer access banking capabilities without building them --- just as a restaurant menu lets you order food without knowing how to cook.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Unbundling of Banking}
\begin{alertblock}{The Problem}
What happens when you break a monolithic bank into separate, independently accessible services?

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Unbundling of Banking (cont.)}
\textbf{The Concept:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Each banking function becomes a standalone service accessible via API
\item Different companies can specialize in one service and do it exceptionally well
\item A single startup can compete with a bank on one specific dimension
\end{itemize}

\vspace{2mm}
\begin{block}{The Insight}
Any service can now be offered independently by a different company. The ``bank'' is no longer a single institution --- it is a collection of components that can be mixed and matched.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Open Banking: Regulatory Approaches}
\begin{alertblock}{The Problem}
How do different regions approach opening up banking data --- and why does the approach matter?
\end{alertblock}

\vspace{3mm}
\begin{columns}[T]
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\textbf{Regulated Approach:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Governments \textbf{mandate} that banks provide APIs
\item Standardized specifications ensure interoperability
\item Third parties must be licensed and supervised
\item Adopted by several European and Asia-Pacific jurisdictions
\end{itemize}

\vspace{2mm}
\textit{``Banks must open up --- whether they want to or not.''}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\textbf{Market-Driven Approach:}
\begin{itemize}
\item No government mandate for standardized APIs
\item Data aggregators negotiate access with banks individually
\item Screen-scraping (sharing passwords) remains common
\item Innovation happens, but without standardization
\end{itemize}

\vspace{2mm}
\textit{``Let the market figure it out.''}
\end{column}
\end{columns}

\vspace{4mm}
\begin{block}{The Insight}
The regulatory approach shapes how fast innovation happens. Mandated standards create a level playing field quickly; market-driven approaches allow flexibility but create fragmentation.
\end{block}

\textbf{What is Embedded Finance?}\\
Financial services integrated directly into non-financial platforms and experiences --- offered at the exact moment a customer needs them.

\begin{block}{The Insight}
When finance is embedded where you already are --- shopping, working, traveling --- the traditional bank becomes invisible. The bank still exists in the background, but the customer never interacts with it directly.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Hands-On Exercise: Notebook NB03}
\begin{block}{Open Banking API Simulation}
In Notebook NB03, you will build a simulated open banking environment:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a mock bank with customer accounts
\item Implement Account Information API endpoints
\item Simulate a token-based authentication flow
\item Build a Payment Initiation service
\item Create an Account Aggregator (multi-bank view)
\end{enumerate}
\end{block}

\vspace{3mm}
\textbf{What You Will Build:}
\begin{itemize}
\item A simulated bank with realistic account structures
\item API endpoints for reading accounts, balances, and transactions
\item A payment initiation endpoint
\item A multi-bank aggregation dashboard
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3mm}
\textbf{Learning Goal}: Understand the mechanics of API-based banking by building it yourself --- even without prior programming experience, the notebook guides you step by step.

\begin{frame}{Section 2.2 Key Takeaways}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{APIs unbundled banking}: Any financial service can now be offered separately via standardized interfaces --- breaking the bank monopoly on financial products

\item \textbf{Regulation drives adoption}: In regions where governments mandate open banking, innovation accelerates; in market-driven regions, adoption is slower and more fragmented

\item \textbf{BaaS enables non-banks}: Companies can ``rent'' banking infrastructure (charter, compliance, ledger) instead of building it from scratch, dramatically lowering the barrier to entry

\item \textbf{Embedded finance is the frontier}: Non-financial platforms increasingly offer financial services at the moment of need, making the traditional bank invisible to the end consumer

\item \textbf{Value accrues to the customer interface}: Whoever owns the customer relationship captures the most value in the API economy --- not necessarily whoever holds the banking license

\begin{frame}{Traditional Credit Scoring}
\begin{columns}[T]
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{alertblock}{The Problem}
Lenders used to rely on personal relationships and gut feelings. How do you scale that to millions of applicants?
\end{alertblock}

\vspace{3mm}
\textbf{The Solution: Credit Scores}
\begin{itemize}
\item A credit score condenses your entire financial history into a \textbf{single number}
\item The number represents predicted creditworthiness
\item Scores span a range from \textbf{very poor to excellent}
\item Higher score = lower predicted risk = better loan terms
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3mm}
\textbf{Where Scores Are Used:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Loan approvals and interest rates
\item Credit card limits
\item Insurance pricing
\item Rental applications
\item Sometimes even employment screening
\end{itemize}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{block}{What Goes Into a Score}
Scores are built from categories of your financial behavior:
\begin{itemize}
\item How reliably you pay bills
\item How much debt you carry
\item How long you have been borrowing
\item How often you apply for new credit
\item What mix of credit types you use
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\vspace{3mm}
\begin{block}{The Insight}
A single number determines the cost of many major life decisions --- your mortgage rate, your credit card limit, sometimes even whether you can rent an apartment.
\end{block}

\vspace{3mm}
\textbf{``Credit Invisible'' --- No Score at All:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Young adults}: Have not had time to build history
\item \textbf{Recent immigrants}: Foreign credit history does not transfer
\item \textbf{Cash-economy users}: Pay for everything without credit
\item \textbf{Divorced individuals}: Shared accounts removed
\item \textbf{Post-bankruptcy}: Wiped history, starting over
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3mm}
\textbf{The ``Thin File'' Problem:}\\

\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{block}{The Scale of the Problem}
Millions of people across every country are excluded from credit --- not because they are risky, but because the system has no data on them.
\end{block}

\vspace{3mm}
\textbf{The Catch-22:}
\begin{itemize}
\item You need credit to build a credit history
\item You need a credit history to get credit
\item This traps millions in a cycle of exclusion
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3mm}
\begin{block}{The Insight}
Millions of creditworthy people are excluded not because they \textit{cannot} repay, but because they lack traditional history. This is the opportunity that alternative data and FinTech try to address.
\end{block}
\end{column}

\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\textbf{Machine Learning Models:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Can discover complex, hidden patterns
\item Handle hundreds of variables simultaneously
\item Significantly better at predicting defaults
\item Much harder to explain \textit{why} a decision was made
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Features}: What transformations? What should we exclude?
\item \textbf{Model}: How much accuracy vs. how much explainability?

\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{The Credit Scoring Pipeline (cont.)}

\begin{columns}[T]
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{alertblock}{The Problem}
Can a ``neutral'' algorithm discriminate?
\end{alertblock}

\vspace{3mm}
\textbf{Sources of Bias:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Historical data bias}:\\
If past lending was discriminatory, the data reflects those patterns --- and the model learns to repeat them
\item \textbf{Proxy variables}:\\
Features like location or school can correlate with race or socioeconomic status
\item \textbf{Sample bias}:\\
Training only on existing customers misses the people who were already excluded
\item \textbf{Feature selection bias}:\\
Human choices about what data to include embed assumptions
\end{enumerate}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\textbf{Real-World Example:}
\begin{itemize}
\item A major technology company launched a credit card
\item An algorithm set credit limits for applicants
\item People in the same household, with shared finances, received \textbf{dramatically different credit limits}
\item The algorithm could not explain why
\item A regulatory investigation followed
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3mm}
\textbf{Fairness Concepts:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Demographic parity}: Approval rates similar across groups
\item \textbf{Equalized odds}: Error rates similar across groups
\item \textbf{Calibration}: Predictions equally accurate for all groups
\end{itemize}

\vspace{2mm}
\begin{block}{The Insight}
Bias in the data means bias in the decisions. Good intentions do not prevent harmful outcomes --- you must actively test for and mitigate bias.

\begin{frame}{Explainability: The Right to Know Why}
\begin{columns}[T]
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{alertblock}{The Problem}
If a machine denies you a loan, who explains why?
\end{alertblock}

\vspace{3mm}
\textbf{Why Explainability Matters:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Regulatory requirement}: In many jurisdictions, lenders \textit{must} tell you why you were declined (``adverse action notice'')
\item \textbf{Consumer trust}: People need to understand decisions that affect their lives
\item \textbf{Model debugging}: Developers need to find and fix errors
\item \textbf{Fairness auditing}: Regulators need to verify the model is not discriminating
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3mm}
\textbf{What an Adverse Action Notice Looks Like:}\\
\textit{``Your application was declined because of: high debt relative to income, short credit history, and a recent late payment.''}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\textbf{Explainability Techniques (Conceptual):}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Feature importance}: Which inputs matter most \textit{overall}?
\item \textbf{SHAP values}: How much did each input push \textit{this specific} decision up or down?
\item \textbf{Partial dependence}: How does changing one input affect the output?
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3mm}
\textbf{SHAP in Plain Language:}\\
Imagine you are splitting a restaurant bill fairly. SHAP assigns each feature its ``fair share'' of the prediction --- showing exactly which factors helped and which hurt.

\vspace{3mm}
\begin{block}{The Insight}
Explainability is both a regulatory requirement and an ethical imperative. Consumers deserve to understand the decisions that shape their financial lives --- and to have a path to challenge those decisions.

\item \textbf{ML improves accuracy but reduces transparency}: Machine learning finds patterns humans miss, but creates ``black box'' challenges for regulators and consumers

\item \textbf{Bias is real and requires active mitigation}: Historical discrimination gets encoded in data; proxy variables can circumvent legal protections; good intentions alone do not prevent harm

\textbf{The Core Question:}\\
Does each customer eventually pay back \textit{more} than it cost to acquire them?
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\textbf{Healthy vs.\ Unhealthy:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lifetime value should be \textbf{several times} the acquisition cost
\item Payback should happen within a \textbf{reasonable timeframe}
\item Churn should be \textbf{low enough} that customers stay long enough to generate returns

\begin{frame}{Unit Economics: The Health Check (cont.)}
\begin{block}{FinTech CAC Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
\item Trust is required for financial products

\begin{block}{The Insight}
Growth without healthy unit economics is just burning money. Always ask: is each new customer profitable, or is the company paying more to acquire them than they will ever earn back?

\textbf{The Blitzscaling Playbook:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Raise large amounts of venture capital
\item Use it to subsidize user acquisition (below-cost pricing, free products, sign-up bonuses)
\item Grow at all costs to reach critical mass
\item Achieve network effects and lock-in
\item Raise prices once dominant

\begin{frame}{The Data Flywheel in Platforms (cont.)}
\textbf{How It Works in FinTech:}
\begin{itemize}
\item More transactions generate more data, which improves fraud detection, which reduces false declines, which attracts more merchants, which generates more transactions
\item More loan applications improve risk models, which enable more accurate pricing, which attracts better borrowers, which generates more data
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{The Insight}
The data flywheel creates compounding advantages that new entrants cannot easily replicate --- it is one of the most powerful moats in modern finance.

\begin{frame}{Discussion: Evaluating FinTech Sustainability}
\begin{block}{Framework: Six Questions for Any FinTech}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Does this FinTech have \textbf{real network effects}, or just growth fueled by subsidies?
\item Are the \textbf{unit economics healthy} --- does each customer pay back more than they cost to acquire?
\item Are \textbf{switching costs} high enough to retain users when prices rise?
\item Does the \textbf{data advantage} compound over time via a flywheel?
\item Can incumbents \textbf{easily copy this} --- or is there a lasting moat?
\item Will \textbf{regulation} help or hurt the company long-term?
\end{enumerate}
\end{block}

\vspace{3mm}
\textbf{Discussion Exercise:}\\
Think about a financial app you use regularly. Apply these six questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item What would happen if the app raised its prices significantly?
\item Could you easily switch to an alternative? Would you?
\item Does the app get better the more people use it, or is the experience the same regardless?
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Section 2.4 Key Takeaways}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Platforms create value differently}: They orchestrate exchanges rather than produce goods --- the most powerful FinTechs are platforms, not pipelines

\item \textbf{Network effects are the goal, but not guaranteed}: Not every FinTech has real network effects --- growth without them is just expensive customer acquisition that evaporates when subsidies end

\item \textbf{Winner-take-most requires specific conditions}: Strong network effects combined with high switching costs and low multi-homing --- without all three, competition persists

\item \textbf{Unit economics determine sustainability}: Lifetime value should be several times the acquisition cost --- venture subsidies mask reality until funding stops

\item \textbf{Multiple moats beat single advantages}: The strongest FinTechs combine network effects, data flywheels, switching costs, and regulatory positioning
\end{enumerate}

\begin{block}{Core Skill}
Always ask: ``Would this business work at \textit{sustainable} prices without subsidies?''
