    "\n",
    "1. **Understand Common Attack Vectors**: Identify and explain the main types of DeFi exploits\n",
    "2. **Analyze Historical Exploits**: Study real-world cases and understand what went wrong\n",
    "3. **Simulate Reentrancy Attacks**: Understand the mechanics through educational Python simulations\n",
    "4. **Understand Flash Loan Attacks**: Learn how uncollateralized loans enable complex exploits\n",
    "5. **Learn Security Best Practices**: Apply defensive patterns to prevent vulnerabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**: This notebook is for **DEFENSIVE EDUCATION ONLY**. Understanding vulnerabilities is essential for:\n",
    "- Smart contract developers building secure protocols\n",
    "- Security auditors identifying weaknesses\n",
    "- DeFi users understanding risks before investing\n",
    "- Regulators assessing systemic risks\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "**Q4:** Compare these three attacks:\n",

    "   - Curve Finance (2023): Reentrancy (Vyper bug) - $70M\n",

    "   Reentrancy was a well-known vulnerability in 2016. Why do you think it still caused a major exploit 7 years later?\n",
    "\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you learned about DeFi security from a **defensive perspective**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DeFi Security Landscape**\n",
    "   - Over $3 billion lost to exploits since 2016\n",
    "   - Major attack categories: smart contract bugs, economic exploits, infrastructure attacks\n",
    "   - Bridges and flash loans are particularly risky attack surfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reentrancy Attacks**\n",
    "   - Occur when external calls happen before state updates\n",
    "   - Prevention: Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern + reentrancy guards\n",
    "   - The DAO hack (2016) was the first major example\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flash Loan Mechanics**\n",
    "   - Uncollateralized loans that must be repaid in same transaction\n",
    "   - Enable both legitimate arbitrage and malicious attacks\n",
    "   - Often combined with oracle manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Oracle Manipulation**\n",
    "   - Spot prices are easily manipulable\n",
    "   - TWAP and multiple sources provide resistance\n",
    "   - Critical for any protocol using external price data\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Security Best Practices**\n",
    "   - Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern\n",
    "   - Reentrancy guards\n",
    "   - Access control\n",
    "   - Timelocks\n",
    "   - Multiple audits\n",
    "   - Bug bounties\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Audit Process**\n",
    "   - Automated tools + manual review\n",
    "   - Severity classification\n",
    "   - Continuous security (not one-time)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security is not optional** in DeFi - bugs mean lost funds\n",
    "- **Multiple layers of defense** are necessary\n",
    "- **Audits are necessary but not sufficient** - many hacked protocols were audited\n",
    "- **Economic security** is as important as code security\n",
    "- **Monitoring and incident response** are critical\n",
