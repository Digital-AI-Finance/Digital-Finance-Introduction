## How to Read Academic Papers

**Effective Strategy (Saves Time):**
1. **Read the abstract** - Does this paper address your question?
2. **Skim introduction and conclusion** - What are the main findings?
3. **Look at figures and tables** - Can you understand the results without full detail?
4. **Deep dive into relevant sections** - Now read the parts that matter to you

**Don't read top-to-bottom.** Academic papers are written for specialists; use this strategy to extract what you need in 20 minutes rather than an hour.
