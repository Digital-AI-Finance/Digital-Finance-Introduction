- [ ] Find a study partner if possible (teaching others accelerates learning)

### During the Course
- [ ] Take notes on key concepts in your own words
- [ ] Pause notebooks to predict outputs before running cells
- [ ] Relate new concepts to prior knowledge
- [ ] Don't skip hard concepts—revisit slides if you struggle

### After Completing
- [ ] Review your notes and reflect on what surprised you
- [ ] Try to explain 3-5 core concepts to someone else
- [ ] Apply the evaluation framework (NB14) to a real digital finance innovation
- [ ] Stay current by following digital finance news with your new vocabulary

## Need Help?

If you're stuck on a concept:

1. **Review slides for that day** - Go back to the visual explanation
2. **Check the glossary** - Is there terminology you haven't seen before?
3. **Rewatch the notebook explanation** - Markdown cells explain the "why" before code
4. **Modify the notebook code** - Experiment with parameters to build intuition
5. **Ask your instructor or classmates** - Explaining confusions leads to clarity

---

## Glossary Link

Key terms are defined in `docs/glossary.md`. When you encounter unfamiliar terminology, look it up there.
