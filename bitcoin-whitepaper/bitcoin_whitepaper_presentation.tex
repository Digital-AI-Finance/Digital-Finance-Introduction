\begin{block}{Abstract (Nakamoto, 2008)}
\footnotesize
``A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.''

``What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.''

\textbf{\color{mlpurple}Proof-of-Work}

\vspace{1mm}

``The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits.''

\textbf{\color{mlpurple}Network Protocol (Section 5)}

\vspace{1mm}

\scriptsize
\begin{enumerate}\compactlist
\item New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.
\item Each node collects new transactions into a block.
\item Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.
\item When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.
\item Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.
\item Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{\color{mlpurple}Incentive (Section 6)}

\vspace{1mm}

\scriptsize
``The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.''

\begin{exampleblock}{Conclusion (Section 12)}
\scriptsize
``We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust. We started with the usual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control of ownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending. To solve this, we proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power.''

\begin{block}{Key Design Principles}
\scriptsize
\begin{itemize}\compactlist
\item \textbf{No trusted third party} -- cryptographic proof replaces institutional trust
\item \textbf{One-CPU-one-vote} -- majority hash power determines truth
\item \textbf{Incentive-compatible} -- honest behavior is more profitable than attacking
\item \textbf{Minimal structure} -- nodes join/leave freely, longest chain wins
