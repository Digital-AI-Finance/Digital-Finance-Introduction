# Digital Finance: From FinTech to Crypto/Blockchain/DeFi

A 6-day intensive BSC-level course designed to give students from any disciplinary background the conceptual vocabulary, mental models, and hands-on intuition needed to understand how digital technologies are restructuring financial services.

By the end of this course, you will be able to critically evaluate digital finance products, understand the mechanics behind them, and form informed views on where the industry is heading.

## Course Overview

### What This Course Covers

This course explores two distinct innovation philosophies reshaping finance:

- **FinTech (Platform Finance):** Improving the existing financial system from within using APIs, data, and platform economics
- **Crypto/Blockchain/DeFi:** Rebuilding trust infrastructure from scratch using cryptography and decentralization

Rather than treating these as separate, the course shows how they are converging and why both approaches matter.

### Course Structure

**Duration:** 6 intensive days
**Total Topics:** 24 across 6 days (4 per day)
**Hands-on Sessions:** 14 Colab notebooks
**Prerequisite:** None (designed for mixed disciplinary backgrounds)

## The Five Pillars

This course is organized around five foundational pillars:

### Pillar 1: Money and Trust in the Digital Age
Understand what money actually is, how trust operates in financial systems, and why friction in traditional finance creates opportunities for digital alternatives.

### Pillar 2: Platform Finance and the FinTech Stack
Learn how technology companies unbundle and rebundle financial services through APIs, data-driven models, and platform economics.

### Pillar 3: Cryptographic Trust and Decentralized Systems
Build understanding of blockchain mechanics, consensus algorithms, and how strangers can agree on a shared truth without central authority.

### Pillar 4: Tokenization and Digital Assets
Explore how programmable digital tokens bridge FinTech and crypto, from stablecoins and CBDCs to real-world asset tokenization.

### Pillar 5: Governance, Risk, and Regulation
Develop critical judgment by examining real failures, systemic risks, regulatory approaches, and governance challenges in digital finance.

## How to Use This Course

### Viewing Slides

Each day's lecture slides are organized in this repository. You can:
- Download slides locally and present/view offline
- Open slides directly in a compatible viewer
- Reference slides while working through notebooks

### Running Hands-On Notebooks

This course includes 14 Colab notebooks that provide guided, hands-on experience with real concepts and tools.

- No programming, mathematics, or finance theory assumed

### Learning Path

The course is designed to be taken sequentially:

2. **Days 2-4** can be taken independently but build on Day 1
3. **Day 5** assumes you've completed Days 2-4
4. **Day 6** synthesizes everything and is best taken last

However, if you have limited time:
- To understand **FinTech only:** Focus on Days 1, 2, and 6.1
- To understand **Crypto/DeFi only:** Focus on Days 1, 3, 4, and 6.1
- To understand **convergence:** Complete the full course (Days 1-6)

## Course Design Principles

This course was built with these principles:

1. **Purpose-Driven:** Every topic has a clear purpose and builds specific competencies. No "important but unmotivated" material.

2. **Accessible:** Technical concepts are built from scratch with tangible analogies. All code is pre-written; students interact rather than write.

3. **Hands-On:** 14 Colab notebooks provide active learning. Students don't just watch—they explore, modify, and analyze.

4. **Integrated:** Topics flow logically from foundations (Day 1) through specialization (Days 2-4) to synthesis (Days 5-6).

5. **Balanced:** A mix of lecture, hands-on work, and discussion. Every day includes active engagement.

6. **Critical:** The course doesn't assume digital finance is universally good. Day 5 systematically examines failures, risks, and governance challenges.
