Crypto is famous for wild price swings. You buy a token today and it could be worth half by tomorrow. But if you want to lend, borrow, or get paid on-chain, you need something that holds its value. Enter stablecoins.

\vspace{2mm}
\footnotesize
\textbf{Three problems volatility creates:}
\begin{enumerate}\compactlist
\item \textbf{Pricing} --- merchants cannot set stable prices in a volatile token
\item \textbf{Lending} --- borrowers and lenders cannot agree on fair terms when collateral swings wildly
\item \textbf{Savings} --- people in unstable economies cannot store value in something that fluctuates more than their own currency
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{2mm}
\footnotesize
These three needs --- pricing, lending, saving --- explain why stablecoins have become the most widely used category of crypto token.

% =======================================================================
\begin{frame}[t]{Think About the Last Time You Sent Money Abroad --- Did You Worry About the Exchange Rate?}
\small
You send money to family in another country. Between the moment you send and the moment they receive, the exchange rate might shift. They get less than you intended. Now imagine sending crypto instead --- the same amount, but the value drops by several percent in transit.

\vspace{3mm}
\small
Now imagine a different version:

\vspace{2mm}
\footnotesize
\begin{description}\compactlist
\item[\scriptsize The token:] A digital coin that always represents the same purchasing power as one unit of a major currency.
\item[\scriptsize The promise:] Whether you send it in the morning or receive it at night, it buys the same amount.
\item[\scriptsize The question:] Who or what guarantees that promise? And what happens if the guarantee fails?
\end{description}

\vspace{3mm}
\small
No conversion fees. No waiting. No exchange rate surprise. But the stability is only as strong as the mechanism behind it.

\vspace{3mm}
\begin{exampleblock}{The Core Idea}
\footnotesize This is the core idea behind stablecoins: digital tokens designed to maintain a constant value. The question is not whether they work --- many do, most of the time. The question is what they depend on, and what breaks when that dependency fails.
\end{exampleblock}

\textbf{Key distinctions:}

\vspace{2mm}
\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}\compactlist
\item \textbf{Fiat-backed} --- a company holds real currency in a bank and issues one token per unit deposited
\item \textbf{Crypto-collateralized} --- a smart contract locks cryptocurrency worth more than the tokens it mints
\item \textbf{Algorithmic} --- software expands or contracts the token supply to push the price toward the target
\end{itemize}

Each approach answers the stability question differently, and each carries a different risk profile.
\end{column}

\textbf{What happened in those six steps:}

\vspace{2mm}
\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}\compactlist
\item No central bank was involved --- a private issuer created the token
\item No blockchain was needed for the reserves --- real currency sits in a traditional bank
\item The peg held because arbitrageurs could always mint or redeem at the target price
\item The trust shifted from ``do I trust this currency?'' to ``do I trust this issuer?''
\end{itemize}

\vspace{2mm}
\footnotesize
The entire lifecycle depends on one assumption: that the reserves actually exist and can be accessed on demand.
\end{column}
\end{columns}

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{block}{}
\footnotesize Every step in the stablecoin lifecycle that relies on a centralized party reintroduces the trust assumptions that blockchain was designed to remove. The stability is real, but so is the dependence.

\vspace{2mm}

\begin{description}\compactlist
\item[\scriptsize Fiat-backed:] simple, stable, capital-efficient --- but you must trust the issuer to hold real reserves, not lend them out, and honor redemptions
\item[\scriptsize Crypto-collateral:] transparent, decentralized, censorship-resistant --- but requires locking up more value than you mint, and collateral can lose value in a crash
\item[\scriptsize Why not both?] Some designs blend approaches --- partial reserves plus algorithmic adjustments --- but hybrid designs carry hybrid risks
\end{description}

\vspace{2mm}

The architecture determines who bears the risk. In fiat-backed, the issuer. In crypto-backed, the depositor.

\begin{frame}[t]{Three Questions That Reveal Any Stablecoin's True Design}
\begin{columns}[T]
\begin{column}{0.55\textwidth}
\small
Before trusting value to any stablecoin, ask three questions. The answers will not tell you which to choose --- but they will tell you what you are depending on.

\vspace{2mm}
\footnotesize
\begin{enumerate}\compactlist
\item \textbf{What backs the value --- and can you verify it?}\\
\scriptsize Fiat-backed tokens point to bank accounts. Crypto-collateralized tokens point to on-chain vaults. Algorithmic tokens point to an assumption. The strength of the answer determines the strength of the peg.

\vspace{1.5mm}
\footnotesize
\item \textbf{Who can freeze, block, or change the rules?}\\
\scriptsize Centralized issuers can blacklist addresses. Smart contract admins can upgrade code. Pure algorithms have no override --- which is a strength until something goes wrong.

\vspace{1.5mm}
\footnotesize
\item \textbf{What happens when confidence breaks?}\\
\scriptsize Fiat-backed tokens have redemption guarantees (if reserves exist). Crypto-backed tokens have liquidation mechanisms (if markets function). Algorithmic tokens have nothing but faith.
\end{enumerate}

\footnotesize The Stablecoin Trilemma says you can optimize for two of three: stability, decentralization, and capital efficiency. These three questions help you identify which two a given stablecoin has chosen --- and what it sacrificed.

\begin{frame}[t]{Your Challenge: Evaluate a Stablecoin Scenario}
\small
A new stablecoin launches with the following design: it is partially backed by government bonds held by a licensed company, and partially stabilized by an algorithm that adjusts supply when the price drifts. The issuer publishes monthly reports but has not completed an independent audit. The token has gained rapid adoption for cross-border payments.

\vspace{3mm}
\small
Apply the three questions from the previous slide:

\vspace{2mm}
\footnotesize
\begin{enumerate}\compactlist
\item \textbf{Backing question:} What backs this stablecoin? Is the backing fully verifiable? What happens if the government bonds lose value?
\item \textbf{Control question:} Who controls this stablecoin? Can the issuer freeze accounts? What does ``partially algorithmic'' mean for the override mechanism?
\item \textbf{Confidence question:} What happens if a major user redeems a large amount at once? Does the hybrid design make the system more resilient or more fragile?
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{3mm}
\begin{exampleblock}{No Single Right Answer}
\footnotesize There is no single right answer. The hybrid design offers partial solutions to multiple problems --- but partial solutions also mean partial vulnerabilities. The point is to practice identifying what each design choice gains and what it gives up.
