\begin{columns}[T]
\begin{column}{0.55\textwidth}
\small
Someone wants to invest in a valuable asset --- a building, a bond, a piece of art. The asset generates income every year. But the minimum buy-in is enormous. Traditional ownership is all-or-nothing: you either own the whole thing, or you own nothing.

\vspace{2mm}
\footnotesize
\textbf{Three barriers traditional ownership creates:}
\begin{enumerate}\compactlist
\item \textbf{Minimum investment} --- high-value assets require large capital that most people do not have
\item \textbf{Illiquidity} --- selling requires finding a buyer for the whole asset, which can take months or years
\item \textbf{Access} --- most people are excluded from the best-performing asset classes entirely
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{2mm}
\footnotesize
These barriers mean that the wealthiest investors have access to the best assets, while everyone else is locked out --- not because the assets are scarce, but because the ownership structure is inflexible.

\begin{frame}[t]{Think About the Most Expensive Thing You Would Like to Own --- What If You Could Buy Just One Percent of It?}
\small
You walk past a building in the city center. It generates rental income every month. You check the price --- it would take decades of savings. You walk on. The building keeps earning, and you keep walking.

\vspace{3mm}
\small
Now imagine a different version:

\vspace{2mm}
\footnotesize
\begin{description}\compactlist
\item[\scriptsize The token:] A digital certificate that represents a tiny fraction of that building, recorded on a shared ledger that anyone can verify.
\item[\scriptsize The income:] Each month, rental payments are distributed automatically to every token holder, proportional to their share.
\item[\scriptsize The exit:] When you want to sell, you list your tokens on a marketplace that operates around the clock --- no agent, no paperwork, no waiting.
\end{description}

\vspace{3mm}
\small
No minimum wealth. No exclusive club. No waiting list. The token handled it.

\vspace{3mm}
\begin{exampleblock}{The Core Idea}
\footnotesize This is the core idea behind tokenization: dividing ownership of real-world assets into small digital pieces that anyone can buy, hold, and trade. The question is not whether the technology works --- it is whether the token truly connects you to the asset it claims to represent.
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{tabular}{l c c}
\toprule
\textbf{Aspect} & \textbf{Traditional} & \textbf{Tokenized} \\
\midrule
Minimum investment & Large capital required & A small fraction \\
Trading hours & Business days only & Around the clock \\
Settlement & Days to weeks & Near-instant \\

Divisibility & Whole units or large lots & Any fraction defined \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{adjustbox}

\vspace{2mm}
\footnotesize
Read the table left to right. Every improvement in the tokenized column comes with a hidden assumption: that the digital token is legally and practically connected to the physical asset. Remove that connection, and the token is just a number.
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.42\textwidth}
\small
\textbf{Key properties of tokenized assets:}

\vspace{2mm}
\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}\compactlist
\item \textbf{Fractional} --- ownership can be divided into arbitrarily small pieces
\item \textbf{Programmable} --- smart contracts automate income distribution and compliance
\item \textbf{Transferable} --- tokens move between wallets without intermediary approval
\item \textbf{Transparent} --- ownership records are public and auditable on-chain
\end{itemize}

\vspace{2mm}
\scriptsize
These properties unlock new possibilities but also create new risks: transparent ownership means anyone can see your holdings, and programmable rules can enforce restrictions you did not expect.
\end{column}
\end{columns}

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{block}{}
\footnotesize The table reveals a pattern: tokenization improves speed, access, and divisibility --- but each improvement depends on a legal bridge between the digital token and the physical asset that no blockchain can build on its own.

\vspace{2mm}
\footnotesize
\begin{description}\compactlist
\item[\scriptsize Entity:] The real-world asset is held by a legal entity whose ownership is represented by the tokens
\item[\scriptsize Compliance:] The smart contract enforces rules about who can buy, sell, or hold tokens --- automating regulatory requirements
\item[\scriptsize Custody:] A licensed custodian holds the physical asset or its legal title, separate from the token issuer
\item[\scriptsize Enforcement:] If a dispute arises, courts enforce the legal wrapper --- not the blockchain
\end{description}

\vspace{2mm}

The architecture works only when the legal layer and the digital layer stay synchronized. A token without a legal wrapper is a claim without enforcement.

\item The custodian mismanages or misappropriates the asset

\begin{frame}[t]{Four Questions That Reveal Whether a Token Is Worth Owning}
\begin{columns}[T]
\begin{column}{0.55\textwidth}
\small
Before investing in any tokenized asset, ask four questions. The answers will not tell you whether to invest --- but they will reveal what you are actually buying and what you are trusting.

\vspace{2mm}
\footnotesize
\begin{enumerate}\compactlist
\item \textbf{Is the token legally connected to the asset?}\\
\scriptsize A token without a legal wrapper is a claim without enforcement. Ask for the legal structure, the jurisdiction, and the custodian.

\vspace{1.5mm}
\footnotesize
\item \textbf{What happens if the platform disappears?}\\
\scriptsize If the platform shuts down, can you still prove ownership? Is the legal entity independent of the platform?

\vspace{1.5mm}
\footnotesize
\item \textbf{Can you actually sell when you need to?}\\
\scriptsize Liquidity on paper means nothing if the secondary market is thin. Ask about trading volume and buyer depth.

\vspace{1.5mm}
\footnotesize
\item \textbf{Who audits the underlying asset?}\\
\scriptsize A tokenized asset is only worth what the underlying is worth. Independent, recent audits are the minimum standard.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{block}{}
\footnotesize Tokenization does not create value --- it changes how value is accessed, divided, and transferred. Whether that change is worth the new risks depends on the quality of the legal bridge, the depth of the market, and the honesty of the people behind the token.

\begin{frame}[t]{Your Challenge: Evaluate This Tokenized Asset}
\small
A startup announces a tokenized investment opportunity. Here is what they claim:

\vspace{2mm}
\footnotesize
\begin{description}\compactlist
\item[\scriptsize The asset:] A portfolio of rental properties in several cities, generating monthly income. The properties are held by a legal entity registered in a single jurisdiction.
\item[\scriptsize The token:] Each token represents a fractional share of the legal entity. Tokens can be purchased for a small amount and traded on the platform's own marketplace.
\item[\scriptsize The promise:] Token holders receive monthly distributions proportional to their holdings. The platform publishes quarterly financial reports but has not completed an independent audit.
\end{description}

\vspace{3mm}
\small
Apply the four questions from the previous slide:

\vspace{2mm}
\footnotesize
\begin{enumerate}\compactlist
\item \textbf{Legal connection:} Is the token legally tied to the properties? What happens if the jurisdiction does not recognize token-based ownership? What recourse do you have?
\item \textbf{Platform risk:} If the startup shuts down, what happens to the legal entity and the properties? Can you prove ownership without the platform?
\item \textbf{Liquidity:} The tokens trade only on the platform's own marketplace. What does this mean for your ability to sell? What risks does a captive market create?
\item \textbf{Audit:} The platform self-reports financials without independent verification. What could go wrong? What would give you more confidence?
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{3mm}
\begin{exampleblock}{No Single Right Answer}
\footnotesize There is no single right answer. The point is to practice distinguishing between the technology's promise and the reality of its implementation. A tokenized asset is not automatically better than a traditional one --- it is different, with different risks, different protections, and different failure modes.
\end{exampleblock}
